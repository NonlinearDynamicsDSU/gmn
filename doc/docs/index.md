## Generative Manifold Networks (GMN)
---
Generative Manifold Networks are a generalization of nonlinear dynamical systems from a single manifold representing a state-space to an interconnected network of manifolds. GMN was introduced by [Pao et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10627), and is under development at the [Biological Nonlinear Dynamics Data Science Unit, OIST](https://www.oist.jp/research/research-units/bndd).
